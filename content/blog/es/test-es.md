My real name is Elihu. Just in case you are wondering, it is pronounced as if you spelled LU.I'm a self-taught developer in my mid-twenties. I do mostly web dev since I'm still learning about game development, but I want to focus on the latter at some point.
Spanish is my mother tongue, although I know quite some English and basic Japanese.
I love learning languages, not just programming ones.

# A little bit of background

I graduated from Industrial Engineering a few years ago. Still, I didn't quite like all the field's professional opportunities, so I decided to self-study programming.
Around April 2020, I started my journey as a web developer.

## Why web development?

My main goal was making games at first, but I found that field really hard to understand as a beginner in programming. Realizing that coding is a core skill for game dev, I started with something more manageable. Web dev made a lot of sense back then, and to be honest, I drifted away from my main goal because of it. And I fell in love with it, so games could wait.

## What's your stack?

I really enjoy React and NextJS for front-end tasks, and that's where I spend most of my time. I'm still learning a few things about back-end, but I feel somewhat comfortable using Express and Fastify for some tasks.
I've used many game engines for game development, but I feel Godot is the best fit for me.

## What do you do?

Professionally, I work as a front-end developer for an email marketing agency. My free time is mainly used to learn something new about web dev, creating new projects, or playing games with my friends.

## What's with this page?

I've been trying to create a place to share the things I learn for a while now. So I built this page from scratch.
Here I'll write some blog posts about the things I like and the ones that I think could be useful for you, in case we share the same interests.

## Why LoLz?

It is just a nickname I go by on the internet. It used to be "lolzwtfomfg", but that's quite long, and people started calling me just "Lolz".
The XVI part was added to create a unique username since the plain name is already in use on most platforms. So I guess we could say 16 is my lucky number.
